        <h4>About Passguard</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I developed this web app as a project to learn the Python Flask framework.
            This represents my first attempt at a project that requires encryption and decryption over IP. The project
            required me to refresh on some skills I haven't used in a long time, such as CSS stylesheets and Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
            This password manager allows you to register an account with a username and password, then uses that username
            to generate a custom encryption key for you. When you store your credentials, they are available only through
            your key. The thought process behind this was to minimize the dangers of a breach by requiring a separate key
            for each user. Meaning if one account key is compromised, other users are still secure.

        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I am a computer science graduate living in southern California. I am attempting to grow my knowledge by
        creating projects that push my abilities. The biggest difference in the projects, like Passguard, compared to
        projects done in college is that these projects are meant to follow industry best-practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hope is that this website provides a useful service for you, and demonstrates my competence in full stack
            web development.
